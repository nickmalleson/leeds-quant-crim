As this was the first meeting, we spend the time on introductions and discussing what we would like from the group.

We decided on a forum-style meeting once per month with lunch and presentations. Ideas for content included:

 - present things that people are currrently doing or have done
 - for advice / critique from the group, or simply for sharing information
 - aim for shorter presentations, with more time for discussion and feedback
 - emphasise methodological aspects
 - themed meetings around specific funding calls or new data sets (as appropriate)

For the meantime, we decided that we would begin by seeing a presentation from each member to better understand the rang of quantitative-criminology work going on at Leeds.

Some people also suggested that specific tutorials or workshops would be useful, including:

- Self exciting point processes (someone to explain the maths)
- Machine learning
- Structural equation modelling
