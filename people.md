## Carly Lightowlers

Carly Lightowlers is an Academic Fellow in Policing Data Analytics at the University of Leeds. Her
role includes delivering on the Data Analytics strand of the [N8 Policing Research
Partnership](http://n8prp.org.uk/): a HEFCE funded knowledge transfer project between 11 police forces and 8 research
intensive universities in the north of England. Carly is a quantitative criminologist whose research
expertise is in the application of novel quantitative methods (notably multilevel and latent
variable modelling techniques) with which to study issues of crime, disorder and criminal justice.
Her research addresses questions about the nature of violent offending behaviour, the role of
alcohol therein, and associated criminal justice responses. Her work capitalises on secondary,
administrative and survey data, such as data gathered by the Home Office, Ministry of Justice,
journalists and the police.
