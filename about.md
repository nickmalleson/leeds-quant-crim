_Under development_

The Quantitative Criminology group is co-convened by Carly Lightowlers (Law) and Nick Malleson (Geography) and aims to bring together those with an interested in crime related research with methodological expertise in analysing quantitive data across the university. Its current membership spans a number of departments and faculties and we encourage participation from other disciplines. The aim of the group is to create a supportive collegial environment in which to share research findings and gain feedback  on work or project ideas that may still be in progress. We aim to meet on the last Wednesday of each month in LIDA.
